## Gameplay preview

**Note**: The GIFs might make the overlay look pretty bad, I promise it looks better in person.

## How to install (manually)

0. Remember to have both your game and `tosu` open! I've seen some people wondering why their stuff is not working only to find out neither was open.
1. Click the `Download the overlay` button at the top of this **document**.
2. Put the folder inside the zip archive into the `static` folder next to the `tosu` executable.
3. Add the overlay as a browser source with the properties in the table below the download button.
4. (Optionally) Customize it to your liking, there's quite a few settings waiting for you!

## Roadmap to v1.0
- [X] Add support for hiding the in-game score meter (using the [Files API](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu/wiki#files-api) and the `settings.background.dim` property)
- [X] Allow for slightly more customization of the Unstable Rate display
- [X] Add support for adjusting hit error tick appear and disappear duration
- [ ] Add support for mania converts (current status: waiting for a new tosu release with a new `beatmap.isConvert` field, see [the conversation in the tosu support server](https://discord.com/channels/1056534107330445362/1185957776665628764/1302703274125824102))

# Roadmap to v1.1
- [ ] Update `index.js` to use the new tosu v4 API (notably the `play.mods.rate` field)
- [ ] Stretch: Add support for StreamCompanion (will think about this only after tosu v4 is released)

## Support

If you have any questions or problems with the overlay, ask either here on GitHub, or send me a DM on Discord as long as it's not something related to modifying the overlay files directly (e.g. feature requests are okay). I'm in the tosu support server, so you can find me more easily this way! (For validating | Username: `kapiwilq`; ID: `147791290908672000`)
